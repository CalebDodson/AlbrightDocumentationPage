      <h1>Sonata for Alto Saxophone and Piano by William Albright</h1>
      <section class="main-section" id="Introduction">
        <header>Introduction</header>
          <p>Born in 1944, William Albright was an American composer, pianist, and organist.  He studied at Juilliard School’s preparatory department, the Eastman School of Music, the University of Michigan, and the Paris Conservatory.</p>  
          <p>After completing his graduate studies at the University of Michigan, Albright became a Professor of Composition at the University of Michigan.  Aside from his composing career, Albright was highly regarded for his interpretations of ragtime and early jazz styles on the organ and piano.  Albright died of liver failure in 1998 in his home in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>
          <p><code>"Ragtime, a beautiful, classical, syncopated music from the turn of the century, has turned out to have a new fascination for composers nurtured in our century's subsequent modernism. Imagination, as well as tonality and rhythmic vitality, could run rampant: why not have fun and sentimentality? It's very avant-garde!" - William Albright</code></p>
          <br><p>Albright composed his work, Sonata for Alto Saxophone and Piano, in 1984 as one of three saxophone sonatas funded by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.  The work was dedicated to his friend George Cacioppo, who died in 1984.  The work is made up of four movements:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>“Two-Part Invention”</li>
              <li>“La follia nuova: a lament for George Cacioppo”</li>
              <li>“Scherzo Will o’ the Wisp”</li>
              <li>“Recitative and Dance”</li>
            </ul>

        <header>I. Two-Part Invention</header>
        <p>An invention is defined as “a device, contrivance, or process originated after study and experiment” and is also a Baroque compositional technique described as “a piece of music for the keyboard, usually written using two-part counterpoint.”  The first movement of Albright’s Sonata, “Two-Part Invention,” encapsulates both definitions as the interplay between the saxophone and piano is a primary characteristic of this movement.  Through sharp articulations and large dynamic swells, this movement highlights the raw emotions Albright experienced during his grieving.</p>

        <header>II. La follia nuova: a lament for  George Cacioppo</header>
        <p>In the second movement, “La follia nuova: a lament for George Cacioppo,” Albright again utilized Baroque compositional techniques: a follia bassline and a chaconne.  This movement includes both introspective passages and pushes the saxophone into both register and dynamic extremes.  In doing so, it highlights Albright’s tumultuous sorrow after losing his friend.  At the end of the piece, the saxophonist is instructed to “turn away from audience… a private performance, perhaps looking into the piano” to emulate saying a final goodbye at a funeral.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="III._Scherzo_Will_o'_the_Wisp">
        <header>III. Scherzo Will o' the Wisp</header>
        <p>Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary defines “will o’ the wisp” as a delusive or elusive goal.  In the third movement, “Scherzo Will o’ the Wisp,” Albright paints a picture of a pursuit of an elusive spirit through flurries of 16th notes and giant leaps in the saxophone’s register.  While this movement is the shortest in the piece, this movement showcases the virtuosity of the saxophone on full display.</p>

        <header>IV. Recitative and Dance</header>
        <p>As described by the title “Recitative and Dance,” the fourth and final movement is opened with an elegant saxophone solo before transitioning into an exciting and reckless “mad dance.”  With its use of bebop, jazz trio writing, sweeping arpeggios, and “bass drum” slams, this movement is an exhilarating finale to the piece.</p>
